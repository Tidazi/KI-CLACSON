# KI-CLACSON

An accessibility program for Killer Instinct (2013) that plays a unique audio cue when a combo reaches level 2, 3, and 4. 
Further functionality of a similar nature might be added in the future. 
CLACSON is pronounced like "claxon", the horn. It stands for Combo Level Audio Cues Seem Obtainable Now... Or something similar.

as of like 12/08/2020 this is basically just a proof of concept i threw together for a friend.
i plan to keep improving it, but i'm basically just an amateur that's learning as she goes.

planned additions include support for all windowed resolutions, and potential support for fullscreen resolutions.
i am investigating the possibility of letting users easily create extra coordinate sets for the combo level detection.
