# KI-CLACSON

An accessibility program for Killer Instinct (2013) that plays a unique audio cue when a combo reaches level 2, 3, and 4. Further functionality of a similar nature might be added in the future.  CLACSON is pronounced like "claxon", the horn. It stands for Combo Level Audio Cues Seem Obtainable Now... Or something similar.
