this is a free and open source utility

the config file must be on a single line,
and each setting is separated by a comma.
there must be a trailing comma after the last setting.

the order of the settings is as follows:

01. killer instinct game resolution
02. amount of delay (in frames)
03. empty (trailing comma is important!)


the amount of delay is related to performance, the longer the delay,
the better the performance will be, at the expense of being
less responsive to changes in combo level.

for resolution text files, the entries must be ordered as follows:

01. height of hits lettering Y coordinates
02. height of combo level boxes Y coordinates
03. player 1 hits lettering X coordinates
04. player 1 combo level 2 X coordinates
05. player 1 combo level 3 X coordinates
06. player 1 combo level 4 X coordinates
07. player 2 hits lettering X coordinates
08. player 2 combo level 2 X coordinates
09. player 2 combo level 3 X coordinates
10. player 2 combo level 4 X coordinates
11. empty (trailing comma is important!)
