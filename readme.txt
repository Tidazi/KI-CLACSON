this is a free and open source utility
made by tidazi (2020)

currently supported resolutions are as follows:
1600x900 windowed
1920x1080 windowed
1920x1080 fullscreen

the amount of delay is related to performance, the longer the delay,
the better the performance will be, at the expense of being
less responsive to changes in combo level.

if the killer instinct window is not the same size as what it's
set to in KI CLACSON's settings for resolution, CLACSON will resize
the killer instinct window in an attempt to ensure that the coordinates
are correct.
