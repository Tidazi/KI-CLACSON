    added back the missing sound file for the P2 fulgore 4pip/8pip audio cue

  v0.0014

    Major change, we're now using GDIPlus for detection.
    This will use slightly more CPU than before, but it will scale MUCH better.
    More functionality can be added as needed with minimal performance impact.
    Additionally, GDIPlus is more responsive and consistent than the old method.

    Basic functionality for Fulgore pip alerts is ready for 1600x900w.
    Alerts exist for: No pips available, 4 pips available, 8 pips available.
    Functional for both P1 and P2 side.
    Support for 1920x1080fs is forthcoming.
